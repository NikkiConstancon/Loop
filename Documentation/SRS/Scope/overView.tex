This document will begin with a discussion on the different interfaces in the system and what they will entail. 
        Then it will outline the system, including who uses the system and the constraints and dependencies that need to be considered.
         The main functionalities of the system will then be depicted as use-case diagrams with a traceability matrix indicating 
         the corresponding relationships between the two. Following this will be a dissection of the requirements into 
         sub-requirements and descriptions that state exactly what they entail. Finally, some extra requirements will
          be outlined that are optional goals depending on time constraints.
