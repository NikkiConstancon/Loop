In terms of storage, most of the information that ReVA works with is stored on the remote cloud server in a Cassandra database after it
has been formatted to adhere to standerdised medical record formats. Since the information is vast and vitally, medically important, Cassandra
was chosen as it is capable of working with large amounts of data in a quick NoSQL manner with zero failure points.\\In terms of local storage
as data is being transfered from device to device, Arduinos temporarily store very small data from attached sensors on their local storage. As
the data from sensors is not very large, it does not hinder Arduino performance. The data then moves to the Raspberry Pi, where it is also placed 
in local storage before it is sent through to the cloud. Once again, data is not large and does not hinder Pi performance. Information coming from the 
cloud server reaches the mobile device and is stored in the mobile device's local storage. As the data that the mobile application reports is not 
large, local storage is sufficient and does not hinder mobile device performance.
