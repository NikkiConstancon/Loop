The functionality of the software interface is to facilitate the communication
between the hardware infrastructure of the devices running the application and
the actual REVA application. An example of this would be the operating system
 of the device in use. The operating system would allow the application to
make use of the internet infrastructure to communicate the necessary informa-
tion to the application. This would enable the device to communicate with the
server and perform the necessary requests.

\begin{enumerate}


\item{\textbf{Client on Mobile} \\
ReVA is compatible on mobile devices running on an Android
OS. The mobile device must have internet capabilities to facility the updating of patient stats on the device.}
\item{\textbf{Database on the Server} \\
ReVA will communicate with a database to store real-time patient stats. This database will also be queried to retrieve historical stats for patients and to provide anonymous stats to researchers.}
\item{\textbf{Raspberry Pi} \\
ReVA will utilise a Raspberry PI to collect the data from the different devices. It will need to communicate the collected data with a server where it can be analysed and utilised as needed.}
