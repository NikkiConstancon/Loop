\subsection{Application Overview}
The ReVA application is an android mobile application designed to report vitals information of registered bedridden patients to registered subscribers (this includes the patients themselves). It is a tool meant to bridge the distance gap between caretaker and patient, allowing for real time vitals data to be monitored from any location with access to WiFi as well as trigger notifications when vitals stray from the norm. ReVA also has the functionality to display statistical and historical vitals information for long term monitoring of patient health. There is also an advice section that may be viewed for additional help. Advice may also be triggered based on notification alerts.

\subsection{Patients}
%suggested format 1:
	%getting started
	You are the patient. This is all about and for you. Patients will have access to their own vitals information as well as be given the opportunity to pick their own passwords to protect said information. If a patient is unable to set up their own account with ReVA, a caretaker should assist in the process. 
	1. Logging in
		Patients will be prompted to login. If a patient has an existing login, skip to step 3. 
	2. Registering
		If a patient does not have a login, they may follow the registration link to fill in their personal information and 			register with ReVA. Patients will have to choose their own password to login as well as a subscriber password which will 		 be used to verify subscriber validity. After they have registered, they may repeat step 1. 
	3. Logged in
		Now that a patient is registered and logged into the system, they may begin using it.
