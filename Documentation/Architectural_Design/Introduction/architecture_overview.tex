\subsection{Overview}
The document begins by giving an overall description of the system in the form of a deployment diagram. After that, the separate subsystems are shown and explained in terms of system types and appropriate architectural designs chosen for them. Then, each artifact within the deployment diagram is given its own class diagram and/or other diagrams which clearly expresses the designs and reasons for the chosen designs.
